# Digital Rain
My take on the famous digital rain effect from the matrix.

[Youtube video of it running](https://youtu.be/9UXcYOdrRUM)

### Running
After installing the package as a global tool, simply run `csharpmatrix` anywhere in your favorite shell.

### Keybinds
While the program is running, there are some buttons you can press to do things.
- `q` - Quit after next frame.
- `ctrl` + `c` - Quit ASAP.
- `d` - Show time how much time is spent in each part of the main loop. Rotates through 2 modes - simple and detailed. (Also off, if you count that.)

### Font
For the best experience, use the font [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack). It's the default in KDE's Konsole.
I chose the characters from the characters that exist in Hack. Other fonts may work, but Hack is guaranteed to work.

### Final Notes
This repo is just for funsies, and there is no promise of support. If you have a problem, feel free to reach out, but there is no guarantee of a response.
