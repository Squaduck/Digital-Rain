# Digital Rain
My take on the famous digital rain effect from the matrix.

### Running
If you have dotnet installed, you can clone this repo, cd into it, and run `dotnet run` in your favorite shell.

If that's too clunky, then you can [install it from Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Squaduck.CSharpMatrix) (Command below) as a global tool and invoke it from anywhere in your favorite shell with the command `csharpmatrix`.
```sh
dotnet tool install -g Squaduck.CSharpMatrix
```

If you don't have dotnet installed, you should download a [release](https://github.com/Squaduck/Digital-Rain/releases/latest) version.

### Font
For the best experience, use the font [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack). It's the default in KDE's Konsole.
I chose the characters from the characters that exist in Hack. Other fonts may work, but Hack is guaranteed to work.

### Final Notes
This repo is just for funsies, and there is no promise of support. If you have a problem, feel free to reach out, but there is no guarantee of a response.
