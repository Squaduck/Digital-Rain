### Running
If you have dotnet installed, you can clone this repo and run `dotnet run` in your favorite shell.
Otherwise, you should download a [release](https://github.com/Squaduck/Digital-Rain/releases/latest) version.

### Font
For the best experience, use the font [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack). It's the default in KDE's Konsole.
I chose the characters from the characters that exist in Hack. Other fonts may work, but Hack is guaranteed to work.

### Final Notes
This repo is just for funsies, and there is no promise of support. If you have a problem, feel free to reach out, but there is no guarantee of a response.
